# classroom-examples
This is a collection of resources and examples of how I think GitHub can be used for a 'classroom' type environment.


My hope is to accomplish the following:
  - Set up a demo application that requires students to complete a programming
    assignment.
  - They must then get it to pass the test suite in order to have their solution
    accepted.

Bonus points:
  - If they can get a grade sent in via LTI based on the number of passing
    tests that would be awesome.
